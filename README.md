# linear-regression-on-media-company-dataset

### Problem Statement
A digital media company (similar to Voot, Hotstar, Netflix, etc.) had launched a show. Initially, the show got a good response, but then witnessed a decline in viewership. The company wants to figure out what went wrong.

### Analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook using these Python libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Date, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Matplotib and Seaborn

#### The steps are broadly:

- Reading and Understanding the Data
- Visualising the Data
- Data Preparation
- Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Building a linear model
- Residual Analysis of the train data
- Making Predictions Using the Final Model
- Model Evaluation
